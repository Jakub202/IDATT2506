# Sudoku App

This project is a mobile Sudoku game developed using React Native. The app is designed to be tested on an Android emulator, specifically the default Pixel 3a emulator provided by Android Studio.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): A package manager for JavaScript, included with Node.js.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): Provides an Android emulator to run and test the app.
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/): A command-line tool for developing React Native apps. Install it globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.

## How to Test

Follow these steps to clone and run the Sudoku app on the Android emulator:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal and clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jakub202/IDATT2506-Apputvikling
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
```
cd IDATT2506-Apputvikling/sudoku
```


3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary Node modules:
```
npm install
```


4. **Start the App**: Once the installation is complete, start the app with:
```
npm start
```


5. **Run Android Emulator**: Launch the Android emulator from Android Studio.

6. **Run the App on the Emulator**: In the terminal where your app is running, press `a`. This will automatically install and run the app on the Android emulator.

Ensure the emulator is running before pressing `a` in the terminal. If everything is set up correctly, the app should open in the emulator, allowing you to test and interact with it.
